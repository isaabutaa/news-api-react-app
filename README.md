# Welcome to Newssource!

This was my very first personal React project at V School. It's a simple application that makes HTTP GET requests to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).
**Disclaimer:** NewsAPI allows me to use their API and make requests locally from a development environment for free, however, that is no longer the case for the hosted site. Still, using this API was good practice.

### The Homepage

On the homepage, the user is welcomed by a beautiful cutout of my face :grin: 
The user is able to enter text in the input field and get back relevant articles related to their search.

### Arabic News

If the user wants to see top headlines from various Arabic sources like I sometimes do :sweat_smile:, then they can click on the Arabic News link.

### BBC

And the user can also see top headlines from the BBC.

### Responsiveness

The website is responsive as well, and a user can experience a mobile-friendly layout:
